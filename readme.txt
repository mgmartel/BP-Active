Make your updates active by dropping images and urls into the activity update field

== Description ==

BP Active converts your activity update field into a richer editor, that automatically parses links (FB-style) and handles image drag and drop.

The plugin tries to create a preview of the built in WordPress Embed, but parses the url FB-style using jQuery LiveUrl if an embed is not available.

This plugin is a complete rewrite of BP Activity Plus. Much credit goes to the authors of this plugin.

If you have (BuddyPress Edit Activity Stream)[http://etivite.com/wordpress-plugins/buddypress-edit-activity-stream/] installed, this plugin also adds edit capabilities for the custom data.

BP Active uses QQ Uploader and jQuery LiveUrl.
